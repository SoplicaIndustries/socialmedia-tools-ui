## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-sm-lib.git

# Navigate to the socialmedia-tools-ui directory
cd react-sm-lib/socialmedia-tools-ui

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Coding Guidelines
